						<h2>What I Do</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I have been a dominatrix my whole life and regularly perform BDSM activities. I am an exotic Spanish woman who has recently moved to London, and am on the lookout for pure submissive pets and slaves that approach me respectfully. Now that you found me... make a strong impression. Do not waste my time by testing my boundaries, trying to “switch” etc. - I honestly do not know what that even is…</p>

						<h2>Our Business</h2>
						<p> <strong> Kick off...</strong> ... your BDSM experience with me! Miss Medussa, is a fantasy where you can ask me to unhinge your secret desires. This will be&nbsp;a kinky education involving yourself and I - in a condensed journey where together, I guide you into the world of  a fetish experience galore! Enter the ultimate opportunity of a once-in-a-lifetime high, and finding yourself in a matter of manners, minutes and seconds...
						  
						  
						  Submit to me! It's time to get deep... The deeper we go, the more easy it will seem. Succumb to your truest feelings imaginable. It's always the right choice in my dungeon. <br>
  <br>
						  My name is Miss Medussa with a "ss". I am&nbsp;a Spanish born fetish model, and&nbsp;Dominatrix,&nbsp;based in London, UK. <br>
  <br>
						  My life has involved plenty of BDSM over more than two decades, so our business together should be seamless as I evolve and adapt to new forms of eroticism you have not yet been enlightened to. I've experienced various different roles in my personal journey, and, this has resulted in a thorough knowledge of bringing out the best in our brief time together in the world. Whether you're an ambitious or easy going soul, I'll secure a niche collar that will encompass your existence and lead you astray into presence of goodness knows. <br>
  <br>
						  Trust is not an easy thing to fulfil. Do you dare trust me? My advice is for you to embrace losing control - and to breathe - listening with respect will count from then onwards. <br>
  <br>
						  In the sessions you pay for, many things are guaranteed to happen. Role play, pegging, CBT, CP (corporal punishment), sensory deprivation, breath control, boot worship,&nbsp;bondage - are a tip of the iceberg. Likewise with more mental or longer term concepts such as financial domination, collars in public, competitions with other subs, corsets (worn casually), corsets (worn seriously), cross-dressing, fitness training, etcetera, are just as appealing to me. Contact me for a time we can go over a contract. I am as nurturing as I am sadistic... <br>
  <br>
						  Being naked before Me, needs to be seen to be believed. But, I will not take your bravery for granted, and therefore promise one hundred percent discretion with zero judgement. There will be no mistakes on my part regarding:- consent, safety, and or sanity. Despite my beautifully anarchic appearance, I maintain my nurturing and respectful principles to you, the client, above all else. <br>
  <br>
						  My subs are nurtured to become better than the best, gaining unforeseen mental, physical, and loving attributes as foundations I'll instinctively re-secure. <br>
  <br>
						  Sessions can be conducted either in my own place, or for a more lubricative experience, a private dungeon is hired. <br>
  <br>
						  Special locations, and travel arrangements are more easily dealt to the right honourable clients that I have met in person - all expenses and background checks need to be guaranteed otherwise. <br>
  <br>
						  Prepaid Skype sessions are also on offer. <br>
  <br>
						  If you can not meet me yet, and want to see me from a distance- I grant you a link to my OnlyFans where you'll see exclusive material ;) </p>
